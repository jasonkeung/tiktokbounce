# Tiktok Bounce
Visually stimulating ball bouncing intended to upload to tiktok as ADHD traps xd

## Installation
This is a gradle project. With an IDE like IntelliJ, simply run the gradle target tiktokbounce2:desktop `other/run` task.
I have this working with Java SDK 17 and language level 9.

## Future
playing a note on each bounce, loading from a song
creating scenes to set up quick variations of the Arena, Player, images, and bounce behavior.
